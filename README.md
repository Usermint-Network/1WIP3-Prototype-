# 1WIP3-Prototype-
Acronym for "One Web Identity Protocol for Web3 - pronounced "WIP-three" is a human-centric decentralized identity and notarization framework that integrates SBT (Soulbound Token) verification, biometric hashing, and cross-chain interoperability between Hedera, XRP Ledger, and Layer 1 ecosystems.

🧭 The “Open Core, Proprietary Edge” Model
You open-source the infrastructure, but monetize the layers that make it usable, scalable, or compliant.
 Here’s how that looks for your architecture:
Layer
Status
Revenue Logic
Core Infrastructure (MVP) — Flask API, Docker, Terraform, DB
Open Source (MIT)
Freely available to all developers; builds reputation and network effect
Cloud Deployment Templates — one-click VM / notarization node installers
Proprietary SaaS
Charge per deployment or per notarization event (like “pay-per-spin-up”)
SBT Verification API — biometric & KYC hash proofs
Tokenized Service
Charge in SBT tokens or micro-fees per identity verification
Cross-chain Settlement Gateway — XRPL ↔ Hedera bridge
Transaction Fee
Take 0.04% “UserMint Fee” on each liquidity settlement (already coded in Gradient 4)
Governance / DAO Tier — on-chain scheduling, maintenance, and upgrades
Membership / Staking
Members stake to participate in governance; fees collected for proposals
Custom Enterprise Integrations — for banks, regulators, or NGOs
Consulting / Certification
License your “Verified Node” standard for compliance or data notarization systems

So the MIT license builds trust.
Your edge services and validation network capture value.

🪙 Tokenized Incentive Model
Because your system uses Hedera + XRPL + SBT:
Mint your protocol token (e.g., UMT = UserMint Token).
Used to pay notarization fees, spin up nodes, and issue verified certificates.
Stake-to-verify model:
Validators or auditors must stake UMT to certify notarizations or verify SBT identities.
If they misbehave, their stake is slashed.
Revenue pool split:
70% of transaction fees → node operators
20% → liquidity fund (cross-chain reserve)
10% → treasury (protocol development fund)
That treasury is what you, as founder, govern through DAO proposals and treasury releases.

🏦 Enterprise-Grade Monetization
Even open systems can attract big institutions under a service agreement model:
Offering
Description
Example
Private Network Deployment
Dedicated UserMint node cluster with SLA and audit trail
Government identity sandbox
API Subscription
Verified endpoint access with guaranteed uptime
Fintech KYC automation API
Custom Governance Layer
Configure local DAO aligned with Torah-based celestial timing
DAO hosting
Compliance Certification
“Certified SBT Oracle” audit stamp
NGOs, enterprises, or law firms use this to validate on-chain IDs

UserMint is a service registry rather than just a code vendor.

🌍 Global Network Value Accrual
 Every open-source contributor increases the network’s total reach.
 Every notarization increases its global credibility.
 Every identity hash increases the network’s proof-of-humanity strength.
 The more it’s used, the higher the utility (and price) of your protocol token and notarization fees.
So:
 → Open-source = mass trust and adoption
 → Token layer = ownership and profit
 → Service layer = continuous income

⚙️ Monetization Flow Summary
 Step 1: UserMint gives away the open core (MIT license).
 Step 2: Host the infrastructure orchestration (Terraform + Docker templates) as a paid SaaS.
 Step 3: Charges for verified API endpoints (compliance, liquidity, notarization).
 Step 4: Tokenize settlement fees and identities.
 Step 5: Build treasury through protocol usage and enterprise partnerships.

💡 6. Tagline 
“Open code, closed loop economics.”
The world can run it.
UserMint owns the registry, the validators, and the standard of truth.
